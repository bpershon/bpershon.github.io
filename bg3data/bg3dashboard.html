            <h1>Baldur’s Gate Shop Sales Dashboard</h1>
            <p>
                The goal of this project was to create a SQL to Power BI end to end dashboard project. I wanted to simulate
                a database with fact and dimension tables. I was fortunate to find a data set on Kaggle (link below) that
                had sales data for a fictional shop based in the award-winning video game Baldur’s Gate 3. Even with the
                data being fantastical, it still had the table structure I was looking to explore. A handful of item tables
                and a customer table to act as dimension tables, and a sales table to simulate a fact table. The data
                had everything I was hoping to find missing values, data errors, and duplicate records. Below you will
                find the SQL queries and Power BI dashboard. I had a lot of fun working with the data and attempted to
                provide some form of narrative below.


                Thank you for taking the time to look at my project =)

                <p>
                    The owner of the Gearspark's Emporium for Adventurers in Baldur’s Gate, Fizzlewhiz Gearspark,
                    has asked us to take a look at his sales for the previous seven years. Mr. Gearspark keeps very
                    detailed records regarding his transactions, products, customers, and inventory. He would like to get
                    a deeper understanding of what his customers are purchasing at the shop. Mr. Gearspark has asked the
                    following questions:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Can you show me our revenue year by year?</li>
                    <li>Which products are the most profitable?</li>
                    <li>What category of products are most profitable?</li>
                    <li>What do our customer demographics look like?</li>
                    <li>Is there any race/class/gender's we should be catering to?</li>
                    <li>Who are our most loyal customers? We would like to send them special deals/info.</li>

                <h2>-Data Cleaning</h2>
                <p>
                    The data set from Kaggle is in a SQLite database, so I started by opening the database using DB
                    Browser and extracting the tables into CSV files. Below the left image shows the original relationships
                    for the data set, the right image shows the model after the cleaning process. Given the stakeholder's
                    questions pertained to sales data, i decided to omit the item details tables from the model.
                    Next I performed the following steps in SSMS
                    <a href="https://github.com/bpershon/bpershon.github.io/blob/master/bg3data/sqlqueries/bg3cleaning.sql" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Click here for SQL):</a>

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Removed redundant price and product name features from the sales table
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Converted the price feature to a single currency unit (CP/SP -> GP)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Converted the date feature from varchar to MM/DD/YYYY date format
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Removed 72 rows with blank sales id from the sales table, all records showed a 9,999 quantity
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Removed 116 rows with blank product id from the sales table
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Removed 3,794 duplicate sales records from the sales table (matching sales id and date)
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    When I first encountered the blank sale id records in the sales table, I planned on just generating
                    unique values, but then I noticed every quantity was 9,999. I decided to discard the values since
                    the sales table had 54,222 remaining records. I followed a similar thought process regarding the
                    records with blank product ids. This was a toy example, so I decided to update the tables before pulling
                    the data into Power BI, but if I was working on an actual database, I would've just filtered out
                    the problem records before pulling the tables. Next, I started to answer the stakeholder's questions,
                    below are the SQL queries and results.

                    Once i had the tables situated from SSMS i pulled them into Power BI. I performed the following
                    steps in the Power Query Editor:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Set the data type for table features (more on this later)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Filtered and removed sales records with quantity values over 5,000 using a custom column
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Used DAX to generate calculated custom column's for total sales, price category, and age category
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Created a date table using DAX
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Added the relationships to the data model for filtering
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    With the data model setup, I created new measure items for units sold, overall sales, and sales for
                    each of the product types. I setup three panels for the dashboard: Sales, Customers, and Products.
                    The three panels share the same skeleton with the time series slicers at the top, and the side
                    selectors filter the figures on customers and products. Item's dynamically update based on the slicers
                    or selected items within other figures, though I have disabled some interactions. For example, choosing
                    2017 on the Year slicer at the top updates all the figures on the sales panel except the Total Sales by Year figure,
                    as this would only be a single dot on the line graph. The Sales panel provides insights on the stakeholder's
                    questions regarding year-by-year revenue, units sold by product type, and top customers. The Customer
                    panel takes a deeper look into the consumer demographics, exploring a variety of customer characteristics
                    including gender, class, race, and age. This panel will provide the stakeholder with the requested
                    customer demographic information. The final panel covers product details, the table at the top
                    displays total sales for each year, along with sales figures for each type of product. The panel also
                    includes figures show the top products by sales, units sold, and price category. The figures provided
                    on the panel will help to answer the product profitability questions the stakeholder had in the beginning.

                    Originally, I had a pie chart showing the total sales based on product type on the Sales panel, but
                    the magical items category dominates the emporium's revenue at roughly 94%. The shop showed steady
                    growth from 2017 to 2020 thanks to the sales of these magical items, with the category making up over
                    50% of the total units sold. In fact, every year but the two most recent has magical items at or above
                    half of all items sold within the shop. These final two years coincide with the two lowest performing
                    years in terms of total sales. I would suggest a renewed focus on the marketing of these items. While its
                    not all bad news for the final two years, poison sales are almost 18% from 2022 to 2023. Potion sales are
                    also at the second-highest total by year for the emporium, a 12% increase from the previous year. These
                    are the next two highest product categories in terms of total sales, but each category only accounts
                    for roughly 2% of the total sales over the past seven years. If the stakeholder wants to market to a
                    specific group, I suggest the Drow and Dwarf races. These two customer races account for the
                    largest number of total sales in magical items, poison, and potions. The renewed emphasis on magical
                    items will make the most impact on total sales.

                <p>
                    I am a huge fan of the game series, and the data set provided a good opportunity to work with
                    multiple tables in both SSMS and Power BI. While working though the stakeholder's questions and
                    performing some preliminary EDA I found a variety of issues with the data: missing values, duplicated
                    rows, and incorrectly formatted data. This was a great way to practice the data cleaning process in
                    both SQL and Power Query, and ultimately was a great reminder to always check your data types when
                    importing tables into Power BI. I had finished the calculated measures and columns, generated all the
                    tables and visuals, the dashboard was complete. The final step was to verify the values against the
                    SQL queries and then I was finished, unfortunately the values didn't match up. To make a long story
                    short, the price field on the all products table was set as an integer (whole number) and not a
                    decimal value. It truncated all those prices less than 1 gp to zero, which caused all the calculated
                    measures to come in under the true value. Once I identified the problem it was an easy fix but did
                    cause me to double check the SQL queries and the data transformation applied steps in Power Query.

                    If there was more time or resources available, I would like to collect data regarding the cost
                    of each product from Mr. Gearspark. With that data available we could dive into the
                    profitability of the Gearspark's Emporium and provide a deeper insight into which products generate
                    the best margins for the shop. The final measure I thought about adding to the dashboard was a last
                    purchase date for each customer, but I didn't want a large list element on the dashboard for the
                    stakeholder to scroll through. This would probably be something I would inquire whether this was
                    information they wanted displayed on the dashboard or not, I'll provide the SQL query and snippet
                    below:

                                    		MAX(CAST(s.date as date)) as last_purchase_date
                                    FROM	[bg3].[dbo].[sales] s
