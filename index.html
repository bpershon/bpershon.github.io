                    Hello, my name is Brad Pershon and I am an aspiring Data Analyst. First, I’d like to take the time to
                    thank you for checking out my portfolio, I know we are all busy and I’m glad you found a few moments to
                    look over my projects. On the left pane you will find links to my completed projects, each project
                    summary page has a link back to this page which acts as a central hub for the portfolio.

                <p>
                    My focus area at OSU was Artificial Intelligence, but I continued to take courses which leaned into Data
                    Science such as Data Mining, Data Visualization, and a second Statistics course as my math elective. I
                    thoroughly enjoyed the course work; in data mining I created my own Adaboost implementation and compared
                    my results to those from scikit-learn’s implementation. The Data Visualization course had us collaborate
                    with the College of Design to create a web-based dashboard using HTML, CSS, and the D3 JavaScript library.
                    This provided a great opportunity to work with individuals with different technical skills to complete a
                    project. The Statistics course was my first opportunity to work with the R programming language.

                    After graduating from OSU, I took some time to resolve a health issue I had been facing. While working
                    through my issue I took a stab at independent game development, this was a great experience as it allowed
                    me to create fun interactive applications. As time passed, I realized that this activity was better suited
                    as a hobby and decided I wouldn’t pursue it as a career.

                    I began working with Kaggle datasets in Jupyter notebooks, coding SQL queries on LeetCode, and creating
                    dashboards in Excel. I discovered Power BI this fall when looking at other options to create data
                    visualizations, I really enjoyed the flexibility of the application and how easily the elements dynamically
                    update based on what the user is selecting. Recently I have spent time going through the Power Query Editor
                    and learning DAX.
