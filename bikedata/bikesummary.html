                <p>
                    The goal of this project was to build a dynamic dashboard in Microsoft Excel. The dataset was obtained
                    from Kaggle and contains sales records for a bicycle shop in Europe. The data has time metrics, customer
                    demographics, product encoding, and financial information for each transaction. I would like the dashboard
                    to answer the following questions:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Can you show the total profit, orders, and items sold?</li>
                    <li>What do our financials look like year over year?</li>
                    <li>When are we most profitable?</li>
                    <li>What are our top and bottom 5 products?</li>
                    <li>What countries do we make the most profit?</li>
                    <li>Do we have more male or female customers?</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

                    This was a straightforward project, first I checked the data for missing values with find
                    and replace function. The data set had no missing values within the records, but it does have two
                    five month gaps at the end of 2014 and 2016. Neither year has any sales data after July 31st. I
                    would need to check back in with the stakeholder to see if the missing data is placed in another file.
                    If not I could continue with the dashboard as is, or infer the sales data on the summary charts by
                    using the mean from prior years. For this dashboard project I continued with the gap in sales data.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The data had most of what I was looking for regarding time metrics. I did create
                    two columns to shorten the Day and Month text to the shorthand formats using the Text function. The
                    final thing I noticed while looking over the data was a slight mismatch regarding the financial
                    values. The first record shows an Order Quantity of 8 and Unit Price of 120, this should come out
                    to 960, but reports the Revenue of the transaction at 950. I wrote a few columns to check the math
                    on the Cost and Revenue columns, then calculated the percentage difference between the reported value
                    and the calculated value. These range from 0 to 27%, my first thought was that it is probably due to
                    some type of sales tax. I come from a computer science background, so this maybe a common occurrence,
                    I would have to check with a stakeholder. In our toy example, we just decided it was sales tax, and
                    varied based on country and sale total.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Once the data was situated, I simply created the pivot tables aggregating over the columns required to
                    answer the questions above. To create the KPI measures asked in the first question I used text boxes,
                    but quickly learned you cannot utilize the GETPIVOTDATA function to populate the element. So, I created
                    reference cells below the pivot tables and fetched the references. Next I created the pivot charts,
                    standard procedure on that front, though I did find a pretty cool formula to format the data labels
                    on the visualizations: <b>[>=1000000] $#,##0.0,,"M";[<1000000] $#,##0.0,"K";General </b>. This will set the
                    trailing M for million or K for thousand based on the value of the field in the pivot table. The final
                    step was to setup the timeline and slicers, report the connections to the underlying pivot tables, and
                    finalize the dashboard worksheet.

                    If I had unlimited resources, then I would like to see the brands of the products included in the
                    sales records. For example, the bikes category has generic products like Mountain-100 black, 42. It
                    would be interesting to see which brand's consumers lean towards. While the customer demographic
                    information is good in the data set, a customer table with a primary key on customer id would also be
                    a welcomed addition. We could look at how often customers purchase the same brand of their previously
                    purchased bike. The final thing I'm going to look into is utilizing one of the dashboard softwareâ€™s,
                    either Tableau or Power BI. It can get a bit tedious doing the dashboard layout, and I imagine
                    software dedicated to the task has more powerful features. The project met my goals, I was able to
                    create a dynamically updating dashboard with slicers and timelines, and I got to learn that you can
                    insert logic into the number formatter for visualizations.
